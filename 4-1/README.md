Couple of snags with the book but overall not too bad. Main one was the use of `insert_opts` when we wanted `update_opts`, and they say `CREATE DATABASE` when they mean `CREATE TABLE` when discussing the latter.

I also extended the grammar to cope with the `COUNT(DISTINCT x)` construct.

Exercises. I'm not going to talk to PostgreSQL on my system directly. The first one also needs way more familiarity with `SQL` than I have. But I'll give the cross reference a go.
